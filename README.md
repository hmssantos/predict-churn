Predict Customer Churn using MachineÂ Learning

What the project does?
This project was designed with the intention of showing people, in a very brief way, how the machine learning implementation process works within the telecommunications business.
In 'Section 2: Data Understanding', I proposed some business questions that were answered throughout 'Section 5: Evaluation'.

Why the project is useful?
It is useful because, in addition to showing how machine learning implementation works in practice, it covers several mathematical and statistical concepts that will solidify the reader's knowledge throughout the article.

How users can get started with the project?
To get started, just follow the walkthrough that I covered in details in the article I wrote for Medium. Also, I made sure to leave the code well commented to give even more support to the reader.

Where users can get help with your project?
Just leave a comment on my post on Medium, and I'll respond as soon as possible.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?
I developed the initial project, but I am open to suggestions and criticism. I believe that the more minds dedicated to a given subject, the better will be the result, so every contribution is valid. Feel free to collaborate.
